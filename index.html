    <h1>The Godolphin Arabian</h1>

        Few horses can claim to have had more effect on the modern Thoroughbred
        than the Godolphin Arabian. Now the subject of poems, novels and
        paintings, this stallion had a pretty rough start.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what history can tell us, it seems he was a small, golden-bay
        Arabian horse born on the Barbary Coast of northern Africa in about
        1724. He travelled to France with four other horses as a diplomatic gift
        to Louis XV, King of France in 1730, but the King was reportedly
        unimpressed. Not being much of a horseman, he saw the terrible condition
        the horses were in after their journey but failed to observe what the
        Vicomte de Manty described as ‘legs of iron’, ‘unequalled lightness of
        forehand’, ‘tail carried in true Arabian style’ – ‘a horse of
        incomparable beauty’. Soon after, the Godolphin Arabian was sold to the
        Duke of Devonshire, Edward Coke, who eventually allowed him to cover a
        mare who had rejected the stallion chosen for her. The resulting foal,
        Lath, was by all accounts the spitting image of his father, and to
        general surprise, became a celebrated racehorse. When Coke died, the
        Earl of Godolphin came into possession of sire, dam and offspring, and
        made the smart decision to breed the same pair again – and again! All
        three colts had the Godolphin Arabian’s conformation, small build,
        golden-bay colouring and unrivalled speed. This was the start of the
        Godolphin Arabian’s legacy of almost 100 foals!
      </p>
      <p>
        At the ripe old age of 29, the Godolphin Arabian died on Christmas Day,
        1753. His grave can still be visited at what was once the Earl of
        Godolphin’s stud in the Gog Magog Hills in Cambridgeshire, England. This
        legendary stallion has had a lasting impact on Thoroughbred bloodlines,
        not least through champions including Eclipse, Silky Sullivan,
        Secretariat, Man o’ War, War Admiral and Seabiscuit (a small bay –
        coincidence? I think not!).
